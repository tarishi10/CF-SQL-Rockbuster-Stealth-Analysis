# Query explanation
This file contains queries for a consistency check, like looking for duplicate data, checking for non-uniform data, and missing values in the Rockbuster Stealth dataset. It also contains queries to perform a summary of the data. 

Check for duplicate data:
SELECT film_id,title,description,release_year,language_id,rental_duration,rental_rate,length,rating,last_update,special_features,fulltext,
COUNT(*)
FROM film
GROUP BY film_id,title,description,release_year,language_id,rental_duration,rental_rate,length,rating,last_update,special_features,fulltext
HAVING COUNT(*)>1;

Check for non-uniform data:
SELECT DISTINCT film_id,title,description,release_year,language_id,rental_duration,rental_rate,length,rating,last_update,special_features,fulltext
FROM film;

Check for missing values:
SELECT * 
FROM film 
WHERE (
    film_id IS NULL
    OR title IS NULL OR title = ''
    OR description IS NULL OR description = ''
    OR release_year IS NULL
    OR language_id IS NULL
    OR rental_duration IS NULL
    OR rental_rate IS NULL
    OR length IS NULL
    OR replacement_cost IS NULL
    OR rating IS NULL
    OR last_update IS NULL OR special_features IS NULL
    OR fulltext IS NULL OR fulltext = ''
);

Summarise the data for quantitative variables:
SELECT COUNT(rental_duration) AS count_rental_days,
       MAX(rental_duration) AS max_rental_days,
       MIN(rental_duration) AS min_rental_days,
       AVG(rental_duration) AS avg_rental_days,
COUNT(rental_rate) AS count_rental_rate,
MAX(rental_rate) AS max_rental_rate,
MIN(rental_rate) AS min_rental_rate,
AVG(rental_rate) AS avg_rental_rate,
       COUNT(length) AS count_length,
       MAX(length) AS max_length,
       MIN(length) AS min_length,
       AVG(length) AS avg_length,
FROM film;

For categorical variables:
SELECT MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY release_year) AS modal_release_year,
       MODE () WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY rating) AS modal_rating
FROM film;
