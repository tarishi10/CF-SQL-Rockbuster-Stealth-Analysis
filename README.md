# ROCKBUSTER STEALTH LLC PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a conventional movie rental company with stores all around the world. Currently,the company is facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. My job as a data analyst at the company is to plan and manage strategies to help the team use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. I am using PostgreSQL to analyse their dataset to make a launch in 2020. 
The key business questions to be answered are:
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
